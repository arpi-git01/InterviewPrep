/*
 * http://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/bubble_sort_algorithm.htm
 * This sorting algorithm is comparison based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and 
 * elements are swapped if they are not in order. 
 * After every iteration the highest values settles down at the end of the array. So next iteration needs not to include already sorted elements
 * 
 * Drawbacks -
 * not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of O(n2) where n are no. of items.
