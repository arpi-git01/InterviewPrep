/*
 * A classic logic puzzle. 
 * Your goal is to move all the pieces from the left post (A) over to the right post (C). 
 * You can only move one disk at a time and you can never put a bigger disk on top of a smaller disk.
 * Hint: Start with 3 disks and remember the pattern. Then, try 4 disks. You'll use the pattern for the 3 disks again!
